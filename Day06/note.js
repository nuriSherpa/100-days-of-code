# Day6: Advanced Closure Patterns

# Understanding advanced closure patterns is crucial for mastering JavaScript. Closures allow functions to retain access to their lexical scope, enabling powerful programming techniques.

## Module Pattern

The module pattern uses closures to create private and public members within a function. This pattern is useful for encapsulating functionality and maintaining state.
